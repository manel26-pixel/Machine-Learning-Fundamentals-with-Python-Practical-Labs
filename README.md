# Machine-Learning-Fundamentals-with-Python-Practical-Labs
This repository contains a series of hands-on practical labs (TPs) designed to build a foundational understanding of machine learning techniques using Python. Each TP focuses on implementing core algorithms from scratch and evaluating their performance on real-world data.
